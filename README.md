Won at BramHacks (City of Brampton)

- Scrape data on upcoming parties/events occuring in Brampton from Facebook
- Display upcoming events and Brampton Transit bus routes
- Based on the events, amount of people attending them, and where the people are coming from (based on the event type and demogrpahic/income data of expected vistors) bus routes nearby are coloured Red to indicate high traffic/demand
- Therefore, through BusForecast, the data collection for upcoming events and expected attendance is automated and displayed in a nice format, allowing the City to easily allocate extra buses depending on this
- The city currently does this process manually and only for very large events/holidays, so this solves a key issue they face, and allows better surge bus routing
